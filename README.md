# __From the Outside Looking In__ - _a Retail Advisors Perspective on Canadian Robo Advisors_
## Overview and Origin
With a background in retail investments and mutual fund sales I have often had the debate on “brick and mortar” mutual fund solutions vs. the slick, fully online, robo advisory services offering low cost EFT (exchange traded fund) portfolios. In this case I will examine the Canadian fintech company Questrade, spefically focsuing on their robo advisory service - quest wealth portfolios.

Questrade is one of the longest standing Canadian fintech companies with roots stretching back to 1999 when Toronto based entrepreneur Edward Kholodenko co-founded the company with three partners. At the time they were focused on providing a low cost solution for DIY investors. In 2014 questrade entered the robo advisory space launching Questrade Portfolio IQ a low -cost EFT portfolio solution targeted to new investors or investors who are not looking to pick individual stocks and securities themselves. The offering was later (2018) revamped and rebbranded as questwealth portfolios we know today.

## Business Activities
To quote from questrade’s site they are “everything a traditional financial institution is not [they] set out to give Canadians better, simpler, and more affordable ways to become financially successful and secure”. Questrade accomplishes this by offering a convenient online investing service for fee conscious investors whether they are sophisticated investors with their own investment plan and ideas or they are hands off investors looking for the ease and simplicity of a low cost EFT (exhnage traded fund) solution. Questrade currently has $25 billion in assets under management and has over 200,000 accounts opened annually making it one of the fastest growing robo advisory services in Canada.

Questrade is known for it's transparent fees which are some of the lowest in Canada, the average MER (management expense ratio) of the underlying ETFs is about 0.19% with Questrade's managemnt fee over and bove that being 0.25% for invesments from $1,000 - $100,000 and 0.20% for accounts over $100,000. This means for the low cost of 0.39% - 0.44% you can have a diversified EFT solution. Compare that to the avegage mutual fund MERs between 2.00 and 2.50% and that's a lot of savings. Now you might be thinkning what about the value of active managment and oversight from porftolio managers in mutual funds? Well that's one of things that sets questrade apart from competitors is they have a team of portolio managers that actively look to provide excess reuturn in upswining markets and added downside protection in downswingin markets.

Questrade provides a quick glance into the technologies they use on the techonlogy section of their careers page (see images below) they have an extensive IT team which allows them to quickly implement changes and updates as new technoligies, problems, and oppotunites arise. I have also included a link to a video which gives provides some inside perspective from the questrade team. I searched high and low to determine which of these technologies powered which parts of questrade but I could not find much of any information. Stackshare listed Microsoft ASP.net, google tags manager, and google fonts as technoligies they utlize which does not provide much of any insight. I also searched for tech blogs to shed some light on the techonlogies behing questrade but found nothing noteworthy. Perpahs this is the downside of the retail advisors perspective but it would seem they keep this informaiton close to their chest.

In general robo adviors use algorithms to help determine individuals' goals, attitude towards risk, and risk tolerance. In questrade's case they would use the results from the questionaire to reccomend one of their 5 EFT portfolios. In addition to this questrade also offers resonbile invstment portfolios which come at a slight higher fee but allow investors to align their personal values with thier investments.   

## Landscape

Questwealth portfolios is part of the robo adivsory domain of the Canadian FinTech industry. Major players in this domain include BMO smartfolio, CIU direct investing, Invisor, Just Wealth, Nest Wealth, RBC invest ease, and wealth simple. Technology has been on the rise for years and the robo adivsory space is a great exmaple of this there have been many start-ups and innovations driving prices (fees) down and the ease of access and low fees have made them desirable by many investors. Consolidation seems to be a trend as well as finaincail firms and instituitons try to provide one stopping shoppoing for financial needs in order to build full reltionships and drive sales and growth. Responislbe investing is on the rise as well as more and mroe investors care about wheree there money is going and what is used for rather than just finacila returns.

## Results

Questwealth portfolios is one of the early adopter of the robo adviosry space in Cananda intially laucning in 2014  they ahve a had great deal growth since then and continue to be one of the biggest robo adviors in Canada. They are know for having rock bottom fees and excellent customer service, they also differentiate themselves by offering a hyrib invsetmen model by incorpating a teaam of portfolio mangers into thier investment decions rather than treadion passive investing done by amny robo adviosrs.

For investment firms and robo adviors one of the key metrics is how much money they manage - what is thier assets under management (AUM). Questrade manages $25 billion in assets and have 200,000+ new accounts opened each year. Another key metirc for robo adviors is fees - how low can you go? Moneysense.ca and ratehub.ca both have great article's comparing key metircs and servies provided by the top robo advisoirs in Canada which I have linked below. Looknig at these comparisons they offer the lowest fees and rank highly int erms AUM as well.

It is no suprise that research and innvoation would be a key factor in how robo adviors are doing relative to their peers. Quest wealth potfolios does very well in this reagrd in fact questrade financial (parent company) has been awared with the best managed canadain companieses designation for 9 consective years (link to article below). This designation is presented to companies that have a clear and concise strategy, capability to invest in R&D, tools and proprietary equipment, and have a strong emphasis on corporate social responsibility.

## Reccomendations

Overall questwealth portolios and questrade as a whole is a great cCndain FinTech company who have been leaders in the domain and continue to innovate. That beingg sadi there is always room for improvement, and in my opninon there is where the perpspective of a retial adviosr comes in handy. A part of the MER for mutual funds goes to cover adivce and service on the account provided by the advisor, ther has been a push for lower fees and fee trasnparency across the indusrty which has led to people having the great debate of adviors vs robo adviors. Luckly these two do not have to be mutually exclusive and some robo adviors have already started this. For ecxample Walth Simple offers financail planning for clients with over 100k and in-depth financail planning for clients with over 500k. Financial planning can help individuals determine how much they need to save for something like retirement and can provide recomendations in regards to accounts types, investment types, timing of goverment beenfits (Old age sucrity, Canada Penion Plan) and much more. Questrade could consider inemlpting a smiliar regime where based account size they offer a certian level of finacial planning . They could also partener with or hire their own team of fee for service (indivaiuls who chartge a flat fee for a finacila plan rather than a eprcantage of assesats) finalcial planners to offer this service for thier clietns. 

Another technology that questwaelth portoflio could leverage/implement would be a service that interperets data from bank account credit cards statments, and ivnestmnet accounts, to help indivudalds track thier spending. I curently work for Libro Credit Union who is currently working with MX Technologies Inc. to creat an app Yooli, which puuls in infomration from ally our financial accounts and will generate a budget based on your sdpedning, a net worth statment based on your assets and libilities, and will giev you an overall finacil healthscore. I ahve personally tested the app thought it was wonderful I meet with peoiple foten who have no idea where there money goes and struggle to save with technoligy like this it cleary lasys out thier spending so tehy dfon;t have to (more infomtion can be found in article below). If queswaelth could leverage this technology to helkp thier clients with budgting it would likely lead to higher automed contribtioin, better reviews, more accounts, and most importnaly would put candians ina better place financially. Lastly referncing wealth simple again they ahve a feature called round up where you can hook up your investment account with your day to day account to round up debit trasnaction to the nearest dollar and ivnst the proceeds in yout waelth simple account. THis would be a greatr addition for qwuest trade and would once agina likely lead to a higher rate of savinvgsg in the lfor clients in th eloing run, and greater finacila health for candians.
