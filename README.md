# __From the Outside Looking In__ - _a Retail Advisors Perspective on Canadian Robo Advisors_
## Overview and Orgin
With a background in retail investments and mutual fund sales I have often had the debate on “brick and mortar” mutual fund solutions vs. the slick, fully online, robo advisory services offering low cost EFT portfolios. In this case I will examine the Canadian fintech company Questrade.

Questrade is one of the longest standing Canadian fintech companies with roots stretching back to 1999 when Toronto based entrepreneur Edward Kholodenko co-founded the company with three partners. At the time they were focused on providing a low cost solution for DIY investors. In 2014 questrade entered the robo advisory space launching quest portfolios a low -cost EFT portfolio solution targeted to new investors or investors who are not looking to pick individual stocks and securities themselves.
